# Transit or Trails? A Decision Framework for Reducing Congestion and Emissions in Halifax

## Decision Statement
**Should the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) transportation planning director prioritize investment in public transit expansion or active transportation infrastructure (bike lanes and pedestrian networks) to reduce urban congestion and greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, given budgetary and land-use constraints?**

## Executive Summary
Halifax Regional Municipality is experiencing sustained population growth alongside increasing pressure on its transportation system. Rising congestion, longer commute times, and transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions pose significant challenges to economic productivity, environmental sustainability, and quality of life. As HRM works toward climate targets and long-term urban development goals, transportation investment decisions have become increasingly consequential.

The transportation planning director faces a strategic allocation decision under constrained budgets and limited urban space. Two leading investment pathways dominate current policy discussions: expanding public transit services—such as increasing route coverage, frequency, and reliability—or prioritizing active transportation infrastructure, including protected bike lanes and pedestrian-oriented streets. While both strategies aim to reduce reliance on private vehicles, they differ in cost structures, adoption timelines, equity implications, and system-wide impacts.

This project frames the decision as a system dynamics problem rather than a narrow infrastructure comparison. Transportation outcomes emerge from interconnected feedback loops involving congestion, mode choice, emissions, land use, and public support. By integrating background research, exploratory data analysis, and causal loop modeling, this project seeks to identify which investment pathway offers the greatest leverage for achieving HRM’s congestion and emissions reduction objectives by 2030, while acknowledging uncertainty and tradeoffs inherent in urban transportation systems.

### Key Feedback Loops (Draft)
- **Reinforcing Loop (R1 – Transit Quality Loop):** Increased transit investment improves service quality, which raises ridership. Higher ridership increases political and financial support for transit, enabling further investment.
- **Reinforcing Loop (R2 – Active Transportation Adoption Loop):** Expanded active transportation infrastructure improves perceived safety and accessibility, increasing walking and cycling rates and generating demand for additional infrastructure.
- **Balancing Loop (B1 – Congestion Pressure / Induced Demand Loop):** Reduced car usage lowers congestion, but improved traffic conditions can induce additional driving, partially offsetting congestion reductions.
