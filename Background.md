# Background: HRM Transit vs Active Transportation Investment Decision

## Why this decision matters (stakes)
Transportation investment decisions are central to Halifax Regional Municipality’s efforts to address congestion, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and support sustainable urban growth. As Halifax grows, congestion can worsen commute times, increase operating costs for businesses and households, and add pressure on road infrastructure. Transportation also contributes meaningfully to greenhouse gas emissions, making mode shift (reducing reliance on private vehicles) an important lever for meeting climate objectives.

This decision matters because large transportation investments create long-lasting “path dependence.” Prioritizing one approach can shape land use, travel behavior, and political expectations for years. If HRM prioritizes transit, it may strengthen regional mobility and equity for residents who do not have access to private vehicles, but transit expansion can require sustained operating budgets and depends on ridership uptake. If HRM prioritizes active transportation, it can deliver relatively quick, lower-cost improvements and encourage short-trip mode shift, but the overall impact depends on network connectivity, public perceptions of safety, and the feasibility of cycling and walking across seasons and trip distances.

## What makes this decision difficult (tradeoffs + constraints)
The choice is non-obvious because both strategies are defensible and compete for limited resources and urban space. Public transit expansion can serve longer-distance trips and support broader mobility goals, but requires capital investment plus ongoing operating funding (drivers, maintenance, frequency). Active transportation infrastructure can be faster and cheaper to deploy per kilometer, but may face political resistance (e.g., reallocating road space or parking), and mode shift may be uneven across neighborhoods depending on density, trip purpose, and accessibility.

There are also system effects and unintended consequences. Transit improvements can reduce car use and congestion, but if congestion falls, driving may become more attractive again (induced demand), reducing gains. Similarly, active transportation investments may be highly effective once a connected network exists, but early investments may show limited uptake if the network feels incomplete or unsafe. HRM must decide where investment has the greatest leverage within the broader system of land use, travel demand, and public support.

## Key stakeholders affected
- **Daily commuters and residents:** experience changes in travel time, cost, and convenience.
- **Transit-dependent populations:** rely on service coverage and reliability for access to jobs and services.
- **Cyclists and pedestrians:** benefit from safer streets and improved connectivity.
- **Local businesses and employers:** affected by worker commuting reliability, customer access, and street design changes.
- **Environmental and community groups:** focused on emissions reduction, safety, and public health outcomes.
- **Municipal taxpayers and decision-makers:** face budget constraints and political tradeoffs.

## Current approach / what has been tried
HRM has pursued a mixed approach, making incremental improvements to transit while expanding active transportation infrastructure in select areas. However, the limited availability of capital funding, operating budgets, and street space constrains HRM’s ability to scale both strategies simultaneously. This project therefore focuses on identifying which investment priority is likely to deliver the greatest improvement in congestion and emissions outcomes by 2030 under realistic constraints.
